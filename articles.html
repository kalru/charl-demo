                <blockquote>
                    <p>Lufthansa Technik Maintenance International's maintenance licence has been suspended "indefinitely" in SA following an unscheduled audit by the SA Civil Aviation Authority.</p>
                    <p>The SACAA is also busy with an unscheduled audit of SAA Technical in relation to "incidents" which led to the grounding of kulula.com and domestic British Airways flights last week.</p>
                    <p>Comair, which operates these flights, was grounded by the SACAA for five days last week following these incidents.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) has "indefinitely" suspended Lufthansa Technik Maintenance International's (LTMI) maintenance licence in South Africa on Wednesday evening.</p>
                <p>This follows on a 24-hour temporary suspension, which started on Tuesday evening.</p>
                <p>"LTMI informed the SACAA Wednesday evening that the company will take a little more time for the final and thorough settlement of the two outstanding issues and that the processing of the two outstanding findings will, therefore, exceed the previously set deadline of 24 hours," Wolfgang Reinert, head of external communications at Lufthansa Technik AG, told Fin24 on Thursday morning.</p>
                <p>The company will submit final resolution proposals to the SACAA later on Thursday.</p>
                <p>"The [SACAA] has accordingly extended the suspension of the approval indefinitely until the closure of the outstanding findings. This suspension expressly applies only to LTMI activities in South Africa and does not affect any other activities of Lufthansa Technik locally," added Reinert.</p>
                <p>The SACAA also confirmed on Thursday that LTMI is now grounded indefinitely as it was unable to close the two outstanding findings before the expiry of 24-hours. According to SACAA, the suspension will be lifted as soon as LTMI has demonstrated "a satisfactory corrective action plan" and related evidence.</p>
                <p>LTMI is a subsidiary of Lufthansa Technik, a subsidiary of the Lufthansa Group, which also owns the airline Lufthansa. LTMI operates Lufthansa Technik's maintenance business for customers outside Germany and holds a maintenance contract with Comair.</p>
                <p>LMTI said on Tuesday that findings made by the SACAA during the unscheduled audit were not directly related to the technical problems that led to the temporary grounding of Comair's kulula.com and domestic British Airways flights last week.</p>
                <p>The SACAA suspended Comair flights for five days last week after what the authority termed "a series of incidents".</p>
                <p>The SACAA confirmed on Wednesday that it is busy with an unscheduled audit of South African Airways Technical (SAAT) related to these incidents.</p>

                    Comair confirmed on Wednesday. It comes just days after the airline operator was allowed to take to the skies again following the suspension of its flights by the regulator.</p>
                <p>Comair operates its own low-cost airline kulula.com as well as British Airways domestically under a licence agreement. Last week the SA Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) grounded Comair flights for five days after what it called a "series of incidents" during flights.</p>
                <p>The QA specialist will be responsible for ensuring compliance with all aviation safety and quality legislation, the auditing thereof and ensuring corrective action if need be, according to the job advertisement on LinkedIn.</p>
                <p>But Comair says the position has nothing to do with the regulator's findings.</p>
                <p>"The SACAA findings regarding personnel related to the Safety department. Three permanent appointments were made in the Safety department. The advertised post is for the Quality Department. There were no SACAA findings relating to staffing in the Quality Department," Comair said in a response to Fin24.</p>
                <p>On Tuesday evening, the <a href="https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/travelandleisure/aviation-watchdog-suspends-lufthansa-techniks-licence-audits-saat-after-comair-incidents-20220323">SACAA suspended the Approved Maintenance Organisation (AMO) licence</a> of Lufthansa Technik Maintenance International (LTMI) after an unscheduled audit. <a href="https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/grounding-of-comair-has-nothing-to-do-with-us-says-lufthansa-technik-20220322">Lufthansa Technik has denied</a> that the SACAA findings had anything to do with the Comair incidents.</p>
                <p>The regulating body is also busy doing an unregulated audit of South African Airways Technical (SAAT) and has indicated this relates to the Comair incidents.</p>
                <p>Both LMTI and SAAT provide maintenance services to Comair.</p>

                <p>Findings made by the SA Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) during an unscheduled audit of Lufthansa Technik Maintenance International (LTMI) are not directly related to the technical problems that led to the temporary grounding of Comair's kulula.com and domestic British Airways flights last week, according to Wolfgang Reinert, head of external communications at Lufthansa Technik AG.</p>
                <p>The SACAA suspended Comair flights for five days last week after what the authority termed "a series of incidents". Comair announced on Monday evening that it <a href="https://www.news24.com/fin24/companies/travelandleisure/comair-shifts-aircraft-maintenance-away-from-lufthansa-after-findings-20220321">had shifted maintenance of its aircraft</a> away from LTMI to South African Airways Technical (SAAT).</p>
                <p>Up to that point, Comair used both SAAT and LTMI to maintain its aircraft. SAAT was doing heavy maintenance, while Lufthansa Technik provided engineering services and day-to-day aircraft checks.</p>
                <p>Comair said it is acting pre-emptively to prevent customer inconvenience.</p>
                <p>LTMI is a full and completely independent subsidiary of the Lufthansa Group and has no direct link to Lufthansa Airlines. LTMI operates Lufthansa Technik's maintenance business for customers outside Germany and holds the maintenance contract with Comair.</p>
                <p>"A regular audit of LTMI by the SACAA in February did not reveal any major complaints and LTMI's approval was renewed," Reinert said on Tuesday.</p>
                <p>SACAA, in turn, confirmed on Tuesday that its audit of LTMI is in the final stages and to date the Approved Maintenance Organisation (AMO) licence has not been suspended.</p>
                <p>Reinert said the company has taken note of Comair's decision to implement "a temporary mitigation plan" to safeguard their operations.</p>
                <p>"The unscheduled audit the SACAA conducted, which ended recently, produced a low single-digit number of findings. These are currently being clarified between LTMI and SACAA."</p>
                <p>On Saturday, one of Comair's British Airways flights from Gqeberha struggled to land at Cape Town International Airport, following an issue with its landing gear indicator.</p>
                <p>In mid-February, an engine-related problem forced a kulula.com flight from Lanseria to Cape Town to divert to OR Tambo International and on 21 February a British Airways flight from East London to Johannesburg had to make an emergency landing due to faulty landing gear.</p>
                <p>Comair said on Tuesday that, should LTMI's AMO not be suspended or reinstated after suspension, it will have the option of moving its line maintenance back to LTMI.</p>
                <p>Comair has been in business rescue since 2020. The Comair Rescue Consortium, comprising several former Comair board members and executives, was chosen as preferred bidder. Comair has indicated that restructuring its balance sheet is ongoing, and funding is still a concern. Last year Comair sold its SLOW Lounge business to FirstRand Bank for R250 million in order to raise funds.</p>
